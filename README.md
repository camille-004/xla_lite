## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-pipx)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/camille-004/python_project.git
cd python_project
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```sh
make install
```

3. **Set up pre-commit hooks**

```sh
poetry run pre-commit install
```

### Adapting the Project

1. **Rename the project**

    Update the `pyproject.toml` file with your project's details:
    ```toml
    [tool.poetry]
    name = "your_project_name"
    version = "0.1.0"
    description = "Your project description"
    authors = ["Your Name <your.email@example.com>"]
    ```

    Then, rename the source code directory from `python_project` to your project name.

2. **Customize or replace the `README`**

3. **Start developing**

    Add your source code to the `your_project_name/` directory and your tests to the `tests/` directory.

## 🛠️ Makefile Commands

This project uses a `Makefile` to simplify various tasks:

- **Installing depedencies**
    ```sh
    make install
    ```

- **Running linters**
    ```sh
    make lint
    ```

- **Formatting code**
    ```sh
    make format
    ```

- **Type-checking the code**
    ```sh
    make type-check
    ```

- **Running tests**
    ```sh
    make test
    ```

## 📝 Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks are configured to run the following checks before every commit:
- **Lint**: `make lint`
- **Format**: `make format`
- **Type Check**: `make type-check`

## ⚙️ Continuous Integration

This project uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration. Check `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for the steps in how the workflow is defined:

- **Install dependencies**
- **Run linters**
- **Type-check the code**
- **Run tests**
